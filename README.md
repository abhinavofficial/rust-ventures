# rust-learning-ventures

Why this repo?

## One single collection of learning example:
There are several small materials to learn from. I would like to save these on github to avoid losing all the good work. I also realize that create new repository each time is also not that useful. 

Solution: I would call learning from each of these materials a separate project and put in under same repo but under difference branch with no-merge. I will try to list all the branches here to keep a track without peeking in details.


## One single collection of random but interesting reads
Sometimes I come across very interesting reads but we do not capture the knowledge anywhere. Would like to dedicate a branch for that purpose.
